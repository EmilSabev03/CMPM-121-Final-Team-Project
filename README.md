# Devlog Entry - 11/17/2024

## Introducing the team

Tools Lead: Emil

Engine Lead: William/Joey

Design Lead: Eder/Emil

## Tools and materials

We are going to be using Phaser 3 for our final team project. Emil, Eder, William and Joseph have used Phaser 3 in past classes such as CMPM 120 and we feel more comfortable with producing a better project with this framework. We will all be using VS code because it is easily accessible and we have all been using it for a while. For now we are going to be using just the standard libraries, and if that changes then we will update the dev log.

The main language we will be using is Javascript since that is the default Phaser 3 language. We will also be using JSON files to store our art data and HTML to format the webpage. We could also improve the look quality of our game with a CSS file. We have used these languages in previous projects.

To create the images and artwork we will creating pixel art with this free site: https://www.pixilart.com/
To create animations of out of the images we will be using this free website: https://www.free-tex-packer.com/app/
Eder and Emil both have experience with creating pixel art and animations with these tools so we feel comfortable relying on them.

Our alternate platform could be switching from Javascript to Typescript since Phaser 3 accepts both programming languages. Since we've coded in Typescript for this class, we also feel comfortable switching to it as our primary programming language.

## Outlook

Since all of us have used Phaser 3 before, we are hoping to edge others teams in experience using this framework. Since Phaser may not be as popular as other frameworks such as Unity and Unreal Engine, we hope to bring a more polished and unique game using Phaser.

We anticpate that the hardest part of the project will be to fulfill all of the requirements on time for submission. Since there are several specific requirements for each iteration of the project, we may either run out of time or have to rewrite our code several times to fit the new requirements for each iteration. 

We are hoping to learn how to effectively follow one singular shared vision as a team when it comes to making a game. Since we are mostly using tools and materials which we all feel comfortable with, or at least have some experience in, we believe that we will be able to properly communicate our design and implementation ideas with one another to bring our vision to life.
